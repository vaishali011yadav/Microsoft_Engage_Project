## Agile Methodology
# What is Agile

Agile is a development methodology adopted today in the software industry. Agile promotes teamwork, flexible procedures, and sle-organizing teams.

# How I Incorporated Agile Methodology During The Development Cycle

SCRUM is a subset of Agile, a framework for developing software. SCRUM takes advantage of different techniques to achieve goals in Agile. SCRUM promotes an iterative model where the planning is performed on a very short term. The basic time working unit is the sprint. SCRUM teams always reason in sprints and their planning is limited to sprints.

SPRINT 1(May 4)
Researching and analysing the various recommendation systems available in the market.

After conducting study on several recommendation systems, the content based   recommendation system was chosen.

I conducted extensive research on different dataset to use in the project whilst also keeping my movie recommendation idea in place, & I eventually settled on TMBD  MOVIE DATASETs.

SPRINT 2(May 15)I started the development process by reading a lot of articles and, of course, watching various YouTube Tutorials.

Did Some Preprocessing of the Datasets.

Worked on python and Jupyter notebook for the first time

I witnessed a lot of bugs, that I was able to more efficiently debug via stack overflow..

SPRINT 3(May 25)My in-depth research made it simple for me to implement my'movie poster' surprise function.

For Website Development i used pycharm,used python3.7 as my python interpretor,worked on streamlit library for the very first time.

And At Last I used Heroku for the final Deplyoment of my Movie-Recommender-System
